# Adversarial_Samples

Because GitHub has a max file size limit of 100MB, some files have to be downloaded from Drive [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V7wDInXk2DPadwVXIuAZBXEKUnTy9zO5/view] :

- cifar10_dataset/cifar-10-python.tar.gz
- All .dat files in ADVERSARIAL_IMAGES/

After you clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Sohanpatro/Adversarial_Samples`

Just dump all these files in the repo. They've been added in .gitignore, so adding them to the repo will not be pushed anytime.
